                    <br>
                    Crazy Eights can be played by two or more players, but here at CardGames.club you’ll have 
                    to deal with one opponent only. Both players are dealt seven cards from a standard 52-card 
                    deck. Crazy Eights is a shedding game, which means your goal is to be the first player to 
                    discard all the cards in your hand. </p>
                   <p> There are many variations of Crazy Eights, and the game is known under other colorful names 
                    like Mau Mau, Craits, Last Card, Switch, Pesten and Swedish Rummy. The description that follows
                     is thus only one of the many ways this game can be played, but of course it is the best one. 
                     It’s fast and exciting.

                    </p>
                    <p><span class="glos-bold">Play</span><br>After the dealer has dealt seven cards to both
                         players, the remainder of the cards is placed face down in the middle of the table.
                          This is the stock from which cards will be drawn. The top card of the stock is turned 
                          face up next to the stock as the first card of the discard pile. </p>
                       <p> A player discards by matching the rank or suit of the top card of the discard pile. An 
                        8 can be played at any time, and allows a player to declare the suit of the card her 
                        opponent has to play. When a player is unable to play, she draws a card from the stock 
                        pile, until she can play one of her cards, or until she has drawn a maximum of three 
                        cards. A player can only draw a card, when she is unable to play.</p>
                        <p>A player has to draw two cards after her opponent has played a 2.</p>
                        <p>When the stock is exhausted, all cards from the discard pile, except the one on top, 
                        are taken, and shuffled to form a new stock pile. </p>
                        <p>The first player who discards all her cards wins the round.
                        </p>
                    <p><span class="glos-bold">Scoring</span><br>The winner’s score is equal to the total value of 
                        the cards remaining in the opponent’s hand. 8’s are worth 50, ace, king queen, jack and 
                        ten all are 10 and all other cards are worth face value. The first player to reach 100 
                        points wins the game.

                <h3><a id="strategy">STRATEGY</a></h3>
                <p>Luck is the main factor in Crazy Eights, but there is some room for strategy.</p> 

                <p>1.	Card Counting: Keep track of the cards played to anticipate your opponents' 
                    moves and adjust your strategy accordingly.</p>
                <p>2.	Holding Wild Cards: Save your eights for crucial moments when you need to 
                    change the suit in play or prevent an opponent from playing a card.</p>
                <p>3.	Suit Control: Play cards from the suit with the highest quantity in your 
                    hand to increase the chances of depleting that suit and gaining control of the 
                    game.</p>
                <p>4.	Blocking: Pay attention to the cards your opponents are playing and use 
                    your cards strategically to block their moves.</p>

            <h3><a id="trivia">TRIVIA</a></h3>
            <p><span class="glos-bold">Origins</span><p>
            <p>The origins of Crazy Eights can be traced back to the 1930s, with the game believed to 
                have been derived from the older card game, Eights.</p>

            <p><span class="glos-bold">Variants</span><p>
            <p>Mau Mau: A German variant of Crazy Eights, Mau Mau introduces additional rules for 
                specific cards, such as reversing the direction of play or skipping the next player's 
                turn.</p>
            <p>Uno: This popular commercial adaptation uses a specialized deck with unique cards and 
                actions, such as Draw Two, Reverse, Skip, and Wild cards.</p>

            <p><span class="glos-bold">Popularity</span><p>
            <p>One of the reasons Crazy Eights is so popular is that the rules are simple and easy 
                to understand. Players take turns playing cards from their hand, matching the suit 
                or rank of the top card in the discard pile. If a player cannot play a card, they 
                must draw cards from the deck until they find one they can play or the deck is 
                exhausted. The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner.</p>
            <p>Another reason for its popularity is the game's flexibility. While the basic rules 
                remain the same, there are many variations and house rules that can be added to make
                 the game more interesting and challenging. For example, some players add extra 
                 rules for certain cards, such as requiring the player to draw extra cards or skip 
                 a turn.</p>
            <p>Finally, Crazy Eights can be played with just a standard deck of cards, making it an 
                accessible game that can be played almost anywhere, at any time. It is a great game 
                for social gatherings, family game nights, or just passing the time with friends.</p>
